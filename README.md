# android-NewsApp
The app uses HackerNews API: https://github.com/HackerNews/API for the content. The app get's the top 20 recent 
stories and lists them in a listview on the MainActivity then when we click on an item from the ListView, another activity is opened and it displays the 
article in a WebView.
